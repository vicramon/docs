Supabase works great with Lazer and it's easy to connect. Simply follow these steps.

## Step 1: Create a read-only user

While you can use your existing user, creating a new read-only user enhances security.

Go to your Supabase project and open the SQL Editor.

Copy and paste this code in, making sure to replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with a secure password.

```sql lines
BEGIN;
CREATE USER lazer WITH PASSWORD 'YOUR_PASSWORD';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE postgres TO lazer;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO lazer;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO lazer;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO lazer;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO lazer;
ALTER ROLE "lazer" with bypassrls;
COMMIT;
```

Click run (or press cmd+enter) to execute the SQL.

## Step 2: Find connection info

While in Supbase, click "Connect" at the top to view your connection info.

Scroll down to "Session pooler" and click "View parameters".

<info>You must use the Session pooler connection at the bottom, the Direct connection will not work</info>

## Step 3: Add connection info to Lazer

In Lazer, go to AI Settings > [Data Sources](https://lazerdata.ai/data_sources), and click "New Data Source"

Fill in the connection info from Supabase.

**However, use your new read-only user:**

Supbase's Sessions pooler parameters will say the user is: "postgres.\<string\>". 

Swap "postgres" with "lazer", but keep the ".\<string\>".

 So the user in Lazer will be: "lazer.\<string\>"

## Step 4: Test Connection

Click "Create Data source", then click "Test Connection" to ensure it's working properly.

## Step 5: Sync Schema

Go back to the Data Sources index, and click "Sync Now" on your new connection. This imports your schema into Lazer so the AI can use it.

That's it, you're all setup!
