## Overview

The Custom Definitions feature allows you to add custom instructions to the AI. The extra instructions will be injected into every request to the AI.

This is useful for a several reasons.

First, if you have shared terminology within your company, you can add it in so that it's always available, and so that everyone is operating on the same definitions.

Second, if you notice the AI using the wrong field for a given request, you can correct it so it uses the right field.

Third, if there's additional domain knowledge that's not present in your Codebase or Database Schema, this is where you can add it.

## How to Use It

1. Go to AI Settings > [Definitions](https://lazerdata.ai/definitions)
2. Click "New Definition"
3. Select the Data source this definition applies to
4. Give it a name. This is for internal reference only.
5. Write the custom definition / instructions

## Examples

Here are a few examples of custom definitions you could add:

#### Add internal terminology

```md
A 'good rating' is when `feedbacks.score` is greater than 3
```

#### Correct the AI

```md wrap
When a user asks for a "completed order", use `orders.completed_at`, don't use `orders.completed_status` â€“ that field is deprecated.
```

#### Add additional domain knowledge

```md wrap
The `orders.order_status` field is an enum. Here's what the numbers mean:
1 - canceled order
2 - completed order
3 - in progress order
