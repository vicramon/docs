## Getting started

To setup Lazer, start by connecting both your database and your codebase. Guides for supported connections are available in the left navigation.

Please contact us at support@lazerdata.ai if you run into any issues or have any questions along the way.

If your database or code hosting platform isn't supported yet, please let us know and we'll add it.
