## Getting Started

To setup Lazer, start by connecting both your database and your codebase. Guides for supported connections are available in the left navigation.

Please contact us at support@lazerdata.ai if you run into any issues or have any questions along the way.

If your database or code hosting platform isn't supported yet, please let us know and we'll add it as soon as possible.
